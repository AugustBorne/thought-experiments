    <h1>Contrasting Societies Thought Experiment<br><br>____________________________________</h1>
    <h2>I. Three societies.</h2>
    <p>A. Teleios (Utopian society)</p>
    <h4>1. All needs and wants are met; disease is non-existent, work is unnecessary, one can play and eat and do whatever they wish for their entire life.</h4>
    <h4>2. Everything is taken care of by computers and machines, so there is no "working class" in the population, all are equal.</h4>
    <h4>3. Anyone can use as much of the resources as they please, there is no money or limits.</h4>
    <h4>4. The only laws that exist are those that keep one from hurting others, whether by attacking physically or mentally.</h4>
    
    <p>B. Imperium (Authoritarian society)</p>
    <h4>1. All needs are taken care of, but only as absolutely as much as that individual needs, and absolutely no liberties such as decoration or other "extravogances".</h4>
    <h4>2. Every day of every citizen is planned to the minute; their work details, feed times, breaks, etc.</h4>
    <h4>3. Breaking the law results in incarceration and harder work for lesser crimes, death for major ones.</h4>
    <h5>- Lesser crimes may include: arguing with peers*; not following proper social etiquette codes; not completing a task to satisfaction; being late for a scheduled event, etc.</h5>
    <h5>- Major crimes include: arguing with a citizen of higher rank; theft, fighting, murder, or anything to do with sabotage.</h5>
    <p>C. Proelium (Anti-technology society)</p>
    <h4>1. They do not use electricity for anything, with everything being done manually or with animals. Non-electrical or steam machines are allowed, such as grinding windmills.</h4>
    <h4>2. Their only resources are that which they've gathered with their own hands, with credits being allotted based on System* algorithms for an individiual's work. Prices of resources sold by venders are also controlled by an algorithm, with variability allowed.</h4>
